    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "What conditions do we treat?",
    "a1": "We provide evaluation and functional recovery for a wide range of musculoskeletal and neurological conditions. We address both acute injuries — such as sprains, dislocations, ligament tears, or tendinitis — and chronic dysfunctions, including postural issues, foot deformities, muscle imbalances, or any joint/muscle stiffness. Postoperative recovery programs are tailored to each stage of healing, with preventive interventions aimed at reducing injury risk and optimizing overall function. Our approach integrates modern physiotherapy and kinesiotherapy principles to restore mobility, strength, and movement quality.",
    "q2": "Do you work with the national health insurance?",
    "a2": "We do not collaborate with the National Health Insurance House. However, we can issue invoices for medical services, including physiotherapy and kinesiotherapy procedures, for reimbursement via private insurance, depending on the patient's insurer requirements.",
    "q3": "Do you work with children?",
    "a3": "Yes, we work with children who are old enough to participate in therapy sessions independently. We do not accept infants or very young children (around 5 years or younger) due to the need for cooperation during one-on-one sessions.",
    "q4": "Do I need a referral from a doctor?",
    "a4": "To properly start a recovery program, an accurate diagnosis is essential. We require either an MRI or an evaluation by a medical specialist—rehabilitation doctor or orthopedist—to determine the condition and structure the therapy safely. If the patient does not have these documents, we collaborate with in-house orthopedic and trauma specialists to ensure proper evaluation.",
    "q5": "What happens during a session?",
    "a5": "A session lasts about one hour and is always individual. Depending on patient needs, physiotherapy and kinesiotherapy exercises are combined and closely supervised. Our facility includes medical gym equipment — elastic bands, bikes, TRX, rowers, wall bars — and modern physiotherapy devices such as laser, tecar, electrotherapy, or cryotherapy. The patient just needs to attend, and we handle the structured recovery program."
